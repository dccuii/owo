## description


This course presents Algebra 1, of which the fundamental purpose of is to formalize and extend the mathematics that students learned during middle school. It deepens and extends the understanding of foundational algebraic principles, linear and nonlinear relationships, and basic statistical principles. Through lectures, interactive exercises, and practical problem-solving, students will refine their algebraic techniques while developing critical reasoning and collaborative skills. The goals of this course are to: 
- build, deepen, and refine students' mathematical knowledge for real-life applications and future courses alike.
- prepare students for standardized tests (Regents, SAT, etc.).
- develop proficiency in mathematical communication, collaboration, summarization, internalization, intuition, and more.
